I am a Research Scientist at Deepmind in London. Previously, I was a PhD student at MIT under the supervision of Joshua Tenenbaum. I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Inference Algorithms. My long term goal is to build agents that learn to solve a variety of goals in diverse environments.
